      <h2 className="hidden">About Me</h2>
      <p>I strive to write clean, readable, reusable code. 
        I have been working primarily with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, 
        but I love a new challenge. 
        Outside of work, you can find me relaxing with my family and exploring 
        the beautiful Pacific Northwest before it erupts in flames.</p>
